ENHANCING FINANCIAL INCLUSION THROUGH AI â€“ FOR CREDIT SCORING AND LOAN ACCESSIBILITY
Artificial Intelligence (AI) is revolutionizing financial inclusion by making credit scoring and loan accessibility more efficient, accurate, and inclusive. Traditional credit assessment methods rely heavily on historical financial data, which often excludes individuals with limited credit histories. AI-driven models leverage alternative data sources such as transaction patterns, mobile usage, and even social behavior to assess creditworthiness more comprehensively. This approach enables financial institutions to offer loans to underserved populations, including small business owners, gig workers, and individuals without formal banking records. By reducing biases and enhancing risk assessment, AI is bridging the financial gap for millions worldwide.

Furthermore, AI-powered chatbots and digital lending platforms streamline loan applications, making the process faster and more accessible, especially in remote areas. Machine learning algorithms continuously improve credit evaluations, reducing default risks and ensuring fair lending practices. Additionally, AI-driven fraud detection systems enhance security, building trust in digital financial services. As AI continues to evolve, its integration with financial systems will democratize credit access, empower economic growth, and contribute to a more inclusive financial ecosystem. By leveraging AI for credit scoring and loan accessibility, we can ensure that financial opportunities are available to a broader and more diverse population.
